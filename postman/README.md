| `product_id` | Dynamic product ID | Auto-populated from responses |
| `user_id` | Dynamic user ID | Auto-populated from responses |
| `order_id` | Dynamic order ID | Auto-populated from responses |
| `auth_token` | JWT authentication token | Bearer token |

## Advanced Features

### 1. Dynamic Variables
The collection uses Postman's dynamic variables to:
- Auto-populate IDs from creation responses
- Chain requests together
- Maintain state across tests

### 2. Pre-request Scripts
Some requests include scripts to:
- Generate test data
- Set authentication headers
- Validate prerequisites

### 3. Test Scripts
Response validation scripts check:
- Status codes
- Response structure
- Data integrity
- Business logic

## Testing Scenarios

### E-commerce Flow
1. Create customer account
2. Browse products by category
3. Add items to cart (simulated)
4. Create order
5. Update order status
6. Track delivery

### Admin Operations
1. Create products
2. Manage inventory
3. Process orders
4. Update order status
5. Generate reports

### Product Management
1. Create product with full details
2. Upload images (simulated)
3. Set pricing and discounts
4. Manage stock levels
5. Update product information

## Error Testing

The collection includes requests to test:
- Invalid data validation
- Missing required fields
- Authentication failures
- Permission errors
- Not found scenarios

## Performance Testing

Use Postman's Collection Runner to:
- Run multiple requests in sequence
- Test with different data sets
- Measure response times
- Validate under load

## Tips for Usage

### 1. Start with Health Check
Always verify the server is running before testing other endpoints.

### 2. Use Sample Data
The "Sample Data Tests" folder provides realistic test data for ceramic products.

### 3. Check Response Variables
Many requests automatically set variables from responses for use in subsequent requests.

### 4. Environment Switching
Create multiple environments for:
- Local development (`http://localhost:5000`)
- Staging server
- Production server

### 5. Authentication
When authentication is implemented, the `auth_token` variable will be automatically set from login responses.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Connection Refused**
   - Ensure server is running: `npm run dev`
   - Check port configuration in environment

2. **404 Not Found**
   - Verify API endpoints match server routes
   - Check base_url in environment

3. **Validation Errors**
   - Review request body format
   - Check required fields in sample requests

4. **Database Errors**
   - Ensure MongoDB is running
   - Check database connection in server logs

### Server Logs
Monitor server console for detailed error information when requests fail.
